[Few-shot Demonstrations]
Instruction: Could you bring some chips to table three, please? Also, it's quite warm here, so could you turn on the air conditioner?
Goal: On_Chips_Table3 & Active_AC
Instruction: If the curtains are already closed or the AC is running?
Goal: Closed_Curtain | Active_AC
Instruction: Please lower the air conditioning temperature and come to the bar counter.
Goal: RobotNear_Bar & Low_ACTemperature
Instruction: Please prepare some waters, and deliver the yogurt to table number one.
Goal:Exists_Water & On_Yogurt_Table1",
Instruction: It's a bit messy here, could you rearrange the chairs? And, if possible, could you bring me an apple to the reading nook?

[System]
[Condition Predicates] Lists all predicates representing conditions and their optional parameter sets.
[Objects] Lists all parameter sets.
[Few-shot Demonstrations] Provide several examples of Instruction to Goal mapping.
1. Your task is to generate the [Instruction] and their corresponding [Goal] represented as a well-formed formula in first-order logic.
2. Utilize [Conditions] and [Objects] to construct the [Instruction] and its [Goal], and apply logical operators (&, |, ~) appropriately to combine these elements. The sentences must consist of exactly two elements and be combined with logical operators (&, |, ~).
    & (AND Operator): Combines conditions such that the result is true only if both conditions are true.
    | (OR Operator): Combines conditions such that the result is true if at least one of the conditions is true.
    ~ (NOT Operator): Negates or reverses the truth value of a single condition.
3. Please generate directly the instruction and the interpretable predicate formulas without additional explanations.
4. The output must be consistent with the format provided in the [Few-shot Demonstrations].
5. Provide 100 examples of such data.
